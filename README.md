A sympel Minecraft Plugin wehre you can do /anvil to open a Anvil GUI without having a Anvil near you. You need to have the Permision to do that what you can easily can chage. It requiers LuckPerms but no other Plugins. If you dont have the Permision you get a message that you dont have the Permisions.

This Plugin is still in developement and will be finished soon.

I will add soon new workblocks...
